## Project Goals

- provides a user interface abstraction layer.
- full encapsulation makes it easier to call interfaces between UIKit, AppKit and WatchKit in SwiftUI.
- provide standard code interpretation documents to bring convenience to developers.
- avoid leaky abstractions by providing thoughtful and easy-to-use extension points for customizing behaviour.
- favour explicitly-defined behaviour over default implementations.
- cultivate an inclusive open source community through respectful discussion.

## Project Inspiration

The original idea came from the fact that using UIKit's interface in SwiftUI was cumbersome. I wanted to simplify the process of interface calling through encapsulation and make the code logic clearer.

## The origin of InterfaceKit

InterfaceKit originated from an iOS App developed by [Saidong Zhang][blog], which calls UIKit interface in SwiftUI. So [Saidong Zhang][blog] wrote a framework to simplify the calling process, which later evolved into an InterfaceKIit. The QQ communication group number of InterfaceKit is 1027277979. InterfaceKit publishes the code under the license of [MIT license][license].
